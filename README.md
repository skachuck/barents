# BSIS Configuration MCMC

This repository provides code for sampling from the Barents Sea Ice Sheet (BSIS) configuration consistent with models of glacial isostatic adjustment, as described in Kachuck (in review). It requires the installation of giapy, which can be found [here](https://github.com/skachuck/giapy/stable). Ice and earth models will be automatically downloaded when installing giapy, and can be viewed. The sampling is performed using the [emcee]() package.
